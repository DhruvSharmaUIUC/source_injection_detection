# source_injection_detection
This repo is mainly used for storing the code for the DESC project "The First Cut: Developing the Initial Catalog Query for LSST Lensed AGNs".
But the tools can be used in other science cases.

`SL_AGN` This folder stores the (original) code for the source injection of strongly lensed AGN in LSST.
`DECam_MMA` This folder stores the code for the source injection of KN in DECam observations.
